# Hardhat Project supporting Mode blockchain

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample NFT contract, a script that deploys and verifies the contract on Mode blockchain.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat run --network <network> scripts/deploy.js
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network> 

npx hardhat verify --network ModeSepolia <address>

```
