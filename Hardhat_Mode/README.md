# Hardhat Project supporting Zora, Optimism and Base blockchain

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample NFT contract, a script that deploys and verify the contract on Zora, Optimism and Base blockchain.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat run --network <network> scripts/deploy.js
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network> 

npx hardhat verify --network ModeSepolia <address>

```
